    <div class='part'>
      <p>So for what seems to have been a very short semester gone in a blur, it's about time I reflect on the past few weeks,
        deliberate my experiences and ponder in a nostalgic mood on what has been and what is to come. So what have I learned
        from DECO1800? To put it shortly, a lot. From working in teams, to understanding different API's and increasing my overall
        skill set in web design, this course has given me a sufficient set of attributes that I will be able to practice and carry
        through to my future career in IT. I've split up some of the most important things I've learnt in a few sections.</p>
        <h2>Team Work</h2>
        <p>I don't think that I've worked in a team quite as diverse as the one that I found myself in for 1800. By diverse I mean
          skill-set wise. I learnt quite a lot about many things just by trying to immerse myself in others work and trying to
          help others out as much as possible. Building ideas and concepts in a team is also a great way to receive constrictive
          criticism on the way you work and on the ideas that you produce. I am confident that I would not have been able to create
          the project, History Chains, without the team and their specific skill sets. Planning ahead and making deadlines was also
          something I learnt. I regrettably say that I learnt this the hard way - with some parts of the assignment being left to
          the last minute either because of mis-communication or laziness, but that's bound to happen, that's team work for you.</p>
        <h2>Web Design</h2>
        <p>After past courses in web design, I never really thought that I was good at it, though after this course, I feel that I
          have received a large boost in my web design skills. In fact, it's something I do for a hobby, in my spare time! I have
          also increased my JavaScript skills greatly. I'm now confident to create dynamic websites that not only display content,
          but let other users interact with it. Throughout the whole course I've been furthered into the joy of web design, and hope
           that I am able to work on projects at the front end. I was also introduced to PHP and the implementation of AJAX.
           Both used in our concept to get data out of the database and arrange it nicely in a div. I developed quite a interest in
           PHP and how it dealt with data in the 'back-end' and bringing it up the 'front end'. Though by no means am I confident or
           fluent with the language. There is still so much more to learn, and with the passion that I took from DECO1800, I'm sure
           I'll become a capable PHP scholar.
        </p>
        <h2>User Testing</h2>
        <p>
          During the many stages of concept creation and deliberation, our team was urged to keep putting our concept through user testing.
          Normally, I would not consider user testing, though after the first round (paper prototyping) we received many comments on our
          design choices as well as suitable and very useful feedback that we may not have received from a team discussion. This course
          has shown me the importance of user testing so much that every time we incorporated a change into the functionality or design
          of the system, we got users to test it. Knowing that you are building for a certain audience is also critically important to
          remember. You are not making the application for yourself.
          With this in mind, the team was able to make changes backed up by user feedback and testing. It was important to us that we
          develop an application that not only satisfied us, but satisfied the target audience, and through user testing, we could
          make a reality check to confirm that our changes and implementation was for the best interests of the audience.
        </p>

        <h2>Design Patterns</h2>
        <p>I was also introduced to a number of useful design patterns that I believe I will use all throughout my career as an IT
          professional. The most important being Model View Controller (MVC). This was introduced in a lecture, and later on explained
          to me in more depth by a team member. Other concepts such as user flow and reductionism have influenced the way I develop my
          websites and applications and these concepts have a heavy weight in our reports.</p>

        <h2>Trove & APIs</h2>
        <p>Lastly, I learnt how to Trove! With this being the first 'API' influenced project I have worked on, it became a steep learning
          curve, and at the start of the course I was anxious as to how I would cope. Though looking back, I believe I have learnt a lot
          and feel that I would be able to implement many other different API's in other concepts. Managing and sorting datasets from
          Trove has also been a steep learning curve, though after a little perseverance and little extra work, I feel that I am
          confident at managing large amounts of data.
        </p>

        <h2>Course Departings</h2>
        <p>So there we have it; another course pretty much completed. There is so much more that I could talk about in terms of what
          I've learnt over the past few weeks, but my fingers can only type so many letters and you can only read so many words. Moreover, I
          have learnt an undeniably gratuitous amount of knowledge during my participation in DECO1800 and am looking forward to using
          these skills later in my life. The course itself was very well structured, with informative lectures and the teaching staff
          being a great resources for knowledge. I would honestly recommend this course to anyone who has a creative mind and a will to
           get things done, or any one whose up for a challenge.</p>
